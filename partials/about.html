					<p>Hi there, this is Huiwen Duan, or Wen (sounds like "when") if you feel that's over complicated. Currently I am a master student at Helsinki University of Technology major in computer science, as you may guess. My main studies include cloud computing, mobility, web technologies, Internet services and security, etc.</p>
					<p>And YEAH, I am a woman in Tech. When I had my first computer at third grade, I thought about to have a job that works with computer in the future. Well, that comes true though, except that most of the office jobs also work with computers nowadays. </p>
					<p> 
					During my leisure time, I love traveling and capturing interesting people and stunning sceneries with my Nikon D90. Sometimes I do a little post-editing to best present the photos original state.
