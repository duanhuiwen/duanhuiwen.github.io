					<p>Hi there, this is Huiwen Duan or if you feel that's over complicated, call me Wen (sounds like "when"). I am a developer with usability in mind, I love simple and beautiful things.</p>
					<p>
					Currently I am a master student at Helsinki University of Technology, major in computer science. My main studies include, but not limitied to, cloud computing, mobility, web technologies, Internet services and security, etc.
					</p>
					<p>And YEAH, I am a woman in Tech. When I had my first computer at third grade, I thought about having a job that works with computer. That does come true though, except most of the office jobs nowadays also work with computers. :D </p>
				
					<p> 
					During my leisure time, I love traveling and capturing interesting people and stunning sceneries with my Nikon D90 and Sony &alpha;7. 
					</p>
