<p>3D Relics was a research project carried out by Media Engineering and Media degree programmes at 
Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, with the purpose of showcasing 3D models of 
historical sites to tourists as an augmentation of reality. To address the requirements, a 
system consisting of a server side web application and an Android mobile application were 
designed and implemented. 
 
The web application was built on Amazon EC2 cloud, using Linux, MySQL, PHP and 
Apache as a server environment. An admin site was created for user to upload 3D models, 
and a web service was built using the principle of representation state transfer (REST) to 
provide a public interface to outside world. The mobile application was developed on the 
Android platform using Android SDK and Metaio SDK. It is a standalone Android 
application capable of displaying AR content with no dependency to internet. 
 
The results proved that a system of deploying 3D models through a web client and 
displaying them as a form of augmented reality on an internet-disabled mobile client was 
feasible. With the rapid growth of mobile computing power and accuracy of inertial 
sensors, more features can be brought to the mobile client, such as location based 
tracking. </p>

			<p>The users groups of this project are mainly students and teachers of Media degree
program in Metropolia and tourists, whose purposes of using the system are different
from each other. The students and teachers at Metropolia want to deploy their 3D
models of ancient times in a meaningful way, while the tourists want to gain more
knowledge about the place they are visiting. The system was designed to have two
parts, the server side web application which was developed by Carol Rodriguez Torres
and mobile application, separating the user group from each other.</p>

			<p>There are three components involved in this communication system, and they are
interacting in the way shown in Figure above.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Server side:</li>
</ul>
<p>3.1
The web application was deployed on Amazon ec2 cloud, using LAMP as a web server.
It has a user interface for students and teachers to upload their 3D scenes and related
information. All the files and information will be stored in the MySQL database and hard
disk on the server. In order to support effective interaction between server and mobile
phones, a web service is provided to the outside world.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mobile client:</li>
</ul>
<p>
By requesting the web service URL, the mobile application will receive a bundle of data
which consists of all the information about the available scenes. After been properly
handled, those data will be presented to tourists. Therefore, visitors can choose to
download the scene(s) and launch it (them) at any time. Considering that the visitors12
may be in lack of internet connection as they arrived at the historical spot, the
augmentation functionality was also designed to be usable under non Wi-Fi or 3G-
enabled situation. In other words, the mobile application can be a standalone
application, as long as the models were downloaded beforehand.</p>

	Results:

</b></p>
<p>
	At the completion of this project, an integrated system has been established; two user
groups were able to perform the desired functionalities through web application and
mobile application. By developing 3D Relics, it was proved that the 3D models can be
presented as an augmentation of the real world. The tracking and rendering results
were satisfying. Apart from most of the AR application on the market, 3D Relics fulfilled
the prime aim of this research project that is to display the AR contents under non-
internet enabled situation. </p>

The project followed the rapid application development methodology. The project
started with the development of preliminary data models and business process models
using structured techniques. In the next stage, requirements were verified using
prototyping, eventually to refine the data and process models. These stages were
repeated iteratively. By apply this methods, the mobile application structure has been
improved several times when the developer found better solutions of optimizing the
performance, and also the structure on the web client has been modified to provide the
desired data for mobile client.</p><p>
The whole development process has consolidated the developerâ€™s Android
programming skills and brought the developer to a new level in understanding Android
design pattern. The developer also come to know that develop an application for
mobile platform is very different from other platforms, as the limited computing power
and the screen size has put many constrains on the application. Thus to effectively
pass information, the application should be taken care of at the design phase.
Furthermore, it was an opportunity to explore a number of other fields, including
computer graphics rendering flow, image processing, 3D modeling and mathematics.
Most importantly, the developer has gained a more thorough comprehension in
software development.
