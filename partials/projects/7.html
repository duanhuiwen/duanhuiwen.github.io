					<p>
						Spagu project studies indoor navigation technologies and solutions for the museum environment. The aim 
is to study the hardware and application-level techniques for users to monitor and guide, as well as a better understanding of users' spatial perception. Indoor navigation is based on the user's identifier(tag), the user's routes will be sent to remote server for further analysis. </p>

<p><b>Project goals:</b></p>
<p>
The target of this project is to develop a wireless indoor tracking and guidance system, where a person or a car carries only a simple tag and the guidance is given with different lights or displays in the surrounding space. In the project we use 2 different wireless locating systems, one is based on BT Low Energy and the other is based on dash7 active RFID tag. Plans for piloting the system are visitors in a museum and cars in a parking garage.

		<p>The result is a tracking and guidance pilot system in WeeGee museums. We will get researched knowledge about the user experience of personal guidance solutions, in terms of what are usersâ€™ needs for personal guidance, what kind of solutions are most pleasant and efficient, and how people walk around in unknown environments.
